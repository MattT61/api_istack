This little command line tool is used to retrieve the latitude and longitude
for a given IP address. It uses the IPStack API to do so, and requires a free
API key to do the work.

To install:
Load all required Python libraries (primarily the requests library, which is a part
of basic Python these days):
pip install -r requirements.txt

This presumes that you have Python 3 (or better) installed on your system.

Notes:
When you have an API key, you must set it in an environment variable called
IPSTACK_KEY in either your startup code or the terminal that you want to run the thing
in. This is to avoid having any secret keys in the code.

Usage:
fetch_ip <ip-address>
where ip-address is the address you want to fetch.
The return from the program is one of the following
Exit Code 0: The program will output the latitude and longitude as a single
comma separated line like:
34.0655517578125,-118.24053955078125

Exit Code 1: The output will be an error message indicating that no parameter was given
Exit Code 2: The output will be an error message indicating that no API Key was found
Exit Code 3: The output will be an error message indicating that the API returned an error (most likely a bad IP address).

Since a caller (or script) can query the exit code, there is no need to output anything but the actual
data needed, as a Unix pipeline app would do.
